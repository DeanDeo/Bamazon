#This application creates an Amazon-like storefront with MySql. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. If the store has enough of the product in stock the order will be fulfilled.

#If the store does not have enough product in stock the customer will get an alert that their order cannot be fulfilled.
